    <h1>Speaker Information</h1>

    <p>
      First, thanks for agreeing to speak. 
      It helps a lot to have great talks and interesting speakers. 
      We appreciate the time and effort that you have put into your talks.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    <p>
      My phone number is 703 727-1307 in case you need to get in touch with me.
      I'll send out a form to collect your phone numbers shortly. That way, we can text or call each other.
      We'll keep that information private, of course.
    </p>

    <h2>Register and Check-In</h2>

    <p>
      Please register for the conference, if you haven't done so. 
      It helps us to have a complete list. Use the code 
      <strong>gg2023vip </strong>
    </p>

      <a href="https://gothamgo.ticketleap.com/gotham-go-2023/" target="_blank">https://gothamgo.ticketleap.com/gotham-go-2023/</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please check in with the registration desk when you arrive and tell them you are a speaker, so we know you are at the venue. 
      And say hello to all of the organizers, especially if we have not actually met you in person before! We want to meet you.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Adapters</h2>

    <p>
      The venue will have an HDMI connection at the podium.
      Please bring your HDMI video adapter (your laptop to HDMI) if you need one.
      We have some adapters to HDMI,
      but adapters sometimes get lost 
      and we are left looking for one at the last minute.
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Projection</h2>

    <p>
      Please try your presentation as soon as you can after you get there, either in the morning or a break. 
      Make sure you have the mirroring, resolution, etc. set up the way you want before your talk. 
      It is much better to have those issues solved before your talk begins!
      There will be power at the podium.
<!--
      The venue will be open to us starting at 7 AM. We will definately be there by 8 AM.
-->
    </p>

    <p>
      The projection is best at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio, but 16:9 will look better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please avoid small text on your slides.
    </p>

    <h2>Wifi</h2>

    <p>
      Wifi access will be poor! 
      Please do not depend upon it. 
      Have a version of your presentation that does not depend upn the internet on your laptop. 
    </p>

    <h2>Speaker T-Shirts</h2>

    <p>
      Let us know your t-shirt sizes so we can save you a shirt.
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQdriGUGnYqoH_8zNLnploTsCbFnbJPUw1hjGkREr2SbiJvQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0" target="_blank">t-shirt size form!</a>
    </p>
-->

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <p>
      Please try to keep your talk to its scheduled length, and please start at your scheduled time. 
      This will give some time for the following speaker to set up, and not go into the break times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schedule is here &mdash;
      <a href="https://gothamgo.com/index.html#schedule" target="_blank">Schedule</a>.
      Let us know if you need to move your times.
    </p>

    <h2>Backup Talks</h2>
    <p>
      We will try to arrange for a back up speaker, in case someone can't be there at the last minute.
      But if you have a second talk, and are willing to give that as a backup if we need it, we would appreciate hearing about it.
    </p>

    <h2>GoBridge Community Party June 8</h2>

    <p>
      We are partnering with GoBridge on a happy hour style meetup the evening before GothamGo, with food and drinks.
      Once the details are confirmed, we will announce this event, so our attendees and speakers can meet each other prior to GothamGo.
      Since the GoBridge event is at the same time as our traditional speaker dinner, we will not have a separate speaker dinner.
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch</h2>

    <p>
      The conference does not provide lunch in house. 
      There are so many lunch places nearby that when we have done that in the past, everyone goes out anyway! 
      But we want to pay for speaker lunches. 
      To make this easy we will provide lunch money in our speaker bags (in a card) for you. 
      Or we can just reimburse you, if you give us a receipt.
    </p>

    <h2>Twitter, etc.</h2>

    <p>
      Tweet about us (Instagram, or whatever)! And please follow the other speakers (and us at <a href="https://twitter.com/gothamgo" target="_blank">twitter.com/gothamgo</a>).
      If you know of a way to reach Gophers in NYC that you think we do not know about, please tell us. Everything helps.
    </p>

    <h2>Location, Getting There, Parking, etc.</h2>

    <p>
      We are at GMU's Arlington VA Founders Hall, rm 126 (the ballroom, on the left side of the building as seen from the street). 
      Parking is possible under the building. 
      You have to go around the back of the building into the alley to get in there, though. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the Virginia Square and Clarendon metro stops are just a couple of blocks from GMU. 
      The location of the building is on our main web page, 
      just click on venue link and it will take you to Google maps to see where we are, or click this link:

    <h2>Did I Forget Something?</h2>

    <p>
      Probably. If I have, I will send another email, and update this. If you have questions, let me know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks again for speaking!
