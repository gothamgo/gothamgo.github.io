    <h1>Speaker Information</h1>

    <p>
      First, thanks for agreeing to speak. 
      It helps a lot to have great talks and interesting speakers. 
      We appreciate the time and effort that you have put into your talks.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    <p>
      My phone number is 703 727-1307 in case you need to get in touch with me.
      Use this
      <a href="https://forms.gle/z3EGmM9MLuNjqi3k8" target="_blank">t-shirt size and phone number collection form</a> 
      for that, please (it looks like most of you have done this already. Thanks!)
      That way, we can text or call each other.
      We'll keep that information private, of course.
    </p>

    <h2>Check-In</h2>

    <p>
      Please check in and let us know you are a speaker at the registration desk when you arrive, 
      so we know you have arrived and we can give you a speaker bag.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Adapters</h2>

    <p>
      The venue will have an HDMI connection at the podium.
      Please bring your HDMI video adapter (your laptop to HDMI) if you need one.
      We have some adapters to HDMI,
      but adapters sometimes get lost 
      and we are left looking for one at the last minute.
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Projection</h2>

    <p>
      Please try your presentation as soon as you can after you get there, either in the morning or a break. 
      Make sure you have the mirroring, resolution, etc. set up the way you want before your talk. 
      It is much better to have those issues solved before your talk begins!
      There will be power at the podium.
<!--
      The venue will be open to us starting at 7 AM. We will definately be there by 8 AM.
-->
    </p>

    <p>
      The projection is best at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio, but 16:9 will look better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please avoid small text on your slides.
    </p>

    <h2>Talk Template</h2>

    <p>
      We won't require a GothamGo-specific presentation template. Some confs do, but not us.
      Feel free to make your presentation however you like.
      We will link a few images here, 
      <a href="https://gothamgo.com/images/three.png" target="_blank">like this one</a>,
      if you want to use those on a slide or two (we have those individually as well, and a few others).
      Those are fun for the intro and/or last slide.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Wifi</h2>

    <p>
      Wifi access is reported to be poor, and maybe even cell phone service as well!
      Please do not depend upon either during your presentation. 
      Have a version of your presentation that does not depend upn the internet on your laptop.
      BTW, having a version on a thumb drive that you can put onto another computer is also smart.
      Sometimes people have trouble connecting to the HDMI, or their computer dies, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <p>
      Please try to keep your talk to its scheduled length, and please start at your scheduled time. 
      This will give some time for the following speaker to set up, and not go into the break times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schedule is here &mdash;
      <a href="https://gothamgo.com/index.html#schedule" target="_blank">Schedule</a>.
      Let us know if you need to move your times.
    </p>

    <h2>Backup Talks</h2>
    <p>
      We will try to arrange for a back up speaker, in case someone can't be there at the last minute.
      But if you have a second talk, and are willing to give that as a backup if we need it, we would appreciate hearing about it.
    </p>

    <h2>GoBridge Community Meetup June 8 (the night before)</h2>

    <p>
      We are partnering with GoBridge on a happy hour style meetup the evening before GothamGo, with food and drinks.
      This is a great way to meet other attendees and speakers prior to GothamGo.
      We encourage all of our speakers to go to this meetup.
      Since this conflicts, we will not have a separate speaker dinner.
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch</h2>

    <p>
      The conference does not provide lunch in house. 
      There are so many lunch places nearby that when we have done that in the past, everyone goes out anyway! 
      But we want to pay for speaker lunches.
      To make this easy we will provide lunch money in our speaker bags (in a card) for you. 
      Or we can just reimburse you, if you give us a receipt.
    </p>

    <h2>Tell Everyone</h2>

    <p>
      Please let everyone know about GothamGo (blog, tweet, etc). It helps to get a good crowd, and that makes everything better!
    </p>

    <h2>Did I Forget Something?</h2>

    <p>
      If so, I will update this. If you have questions, please ask. Probably someone else has that same question, and I can put that here, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks again for speaking!
