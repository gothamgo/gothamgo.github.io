    <h1>Speaker Information</h1>

    <p>
      First, thanks for agreeing to speak. 
      It helps a lot to have great talks and interesting speakers. 
      We appreciate the time and effort that you have put into your talks.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

    <p>
      My phone number is 703 727-1307. Please email me yours, just in case.
    </p>

    <h2>Register and Check-In</h2>

    <p>
      Please register for the conference, if you haven't done so. 
      It helps us to have a complete list. Use the code 
      <strong>fr2022speaker</strong>
    </p>

      <a href="https://frontrunners.ticketleap.com/frontrunners2022/" target="_blank">https://frontrunners.ticketleap.com/frontrunners2022/</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please check in with the registration desk when you arrive and tell them you are a speaker, so we know you are at the venue. 
      And say hello to all of the organizers, especially if we have not actually met you in person before! We want to meet you.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Adapters</h2>

    <p>
      Please bring your HDMI video adapter (your laptop to HDMI) if you need one.
      The venue uses HDMI. 
      I have an adapter from USB-C to HDMI,
      but adapters sometimes get lost 
      and we are left looking for one at the last minute.
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Projection</h2>

    <p>
      Please try your presentation as soon as you can after you get there, either in the morning or a break. 
      Make sure you have the mirroring, resolution, etc. set up the way you want before your talk. 
      It is much better to have those issues solved before your talk begins!
      There will be power at the podium.
      The venue will be open to us starting at 7 AM. We will definately be there by 8 AM.
    </p>

    <h2>Wifi</h2>

    <p>
      Wifi will be available, but as always it might not work! 
      Please do not depend upon it. 
      Have a version of your presentation on your laptop. 
      You will need to get a wireless account there, I believe. I am checking on that now.
    </p>

    <p>
      The projection is best at 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio, but 16:9 will look better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please avoid small text on your slides.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaker T-Shirts</h2>

    <p>
      Let us know your t-shirt sizes so we can save you a shirt.

    </p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <p>
      Please try to keep your talk to its scheduled length, and please start at your scheduled time. 
      This will give some time for the following speaker to set up, and not go into the break times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The schedule is here:

    <h2>Backup Talks</h2>
    <p>
      As sometimes happens, we have one speaker who might have jury duty on the day of Frontrunners.
      We won't know the outcome of that until the last minute, unfortunately.
      So, if you have a second talk, and are willing to give that as a backup, we would appreciate it.
    </p>

    <h2>Lunch</h2>

    <p>
      The conference does not provide lunch. There are so many lunch places nearby that when we have done that in the past, everyone goes out anyway! 
      But we want to pay for speaker lunches. Please get a $20 bill from the registration desk or any of the organizers for that before you go out 
      (or more if you need it, especially if you can give us a receipt).
    </p>

    <h2>Twitter</h2>

    <p>
      Tweet about us! And please follow the other speakers (and us at <a href="https://twitter.com/frontrunnersdc" target="_blank">twitter.com/frontrunnersdc</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>Location, Getting There, Parking, etc.</h2>

    <p>
      We are at GMU's Arlington VA Founders Hall, rm 126 (the ballroom, on the left side of the building as seen from the street). 
      Parking is possible under the building. 
      You have to go around the back of the building into the alley to get in there, though. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the Virginia Square and Clarendon metro stops are just a couple of blocks from GMU. 
      The location of the building is on our main web page, 
      just click on venue link and it will take you to Google maps to see where we are, or click this link:

    </p>

    <h2>No Speakers Dinner</h2>

    <p>
      We only had one speaker respond to our question about holding a speaker dinner. Normally, this would not stop us from having one anyway, 
      because we love those, but unfortunately we need to devote late Thursday afternoon (and possibly evening) 
      to getting our video recording equipment organized and ready.
    </p>

    <h2>Did I Forget Something?</h2>

    <p>
      Probably. If I have, I will send another email. If you have questions, let me know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks again for speaking!
